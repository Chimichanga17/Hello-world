# Hello-world(didn't change the default title so people won't open it....I'M A GENIUS!!!..LOL..JK)
My first repository ^_^..(whatever that is)

This is my commit message..........
OMG....i just wrote something in the readme in this branch
so.................that makes it different from the master file in this repository named "Hello world"
OMG!!!!!!!!!!    we're AWESOME!!!!!!!!
(PS. i we wrote "awesome" in all caps on purpose (shades on) coz.........it describes us)
YAY!!!!!!!
i feel so accomplished
cuz.......we wrote over 10 lines of random non-sense that came to our minds ....on GOTHUB!!!!!!!!that makes us proffessionals right?
OMG ......we're so good at this
(PS...in case you were wondering.....by "we", i mean chimichanga and willy nilly).......(you get the code names right?) *wink* ;)
